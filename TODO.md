# Seems easy
- make readme
- don't use macros for the smitty run test suite commands

# Doesn't seem too hard
- report expectation failure intelligently
- some sorta opts struct for smitty_run_test_suite to add hooks

# Seems hard
- report if there is an error in a hook in an intelligent way
- automatically register tests. at least render a warning for unregistered tests?
